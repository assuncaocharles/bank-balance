# Bank Balance API Simulation

This repository has 3 main projects [Bank Balance API - CLOJURE]('./bank-balance-api'), [Bank Balance API - NODE]('./bank-balance-api-node') and [Bank Balance CLIENT]('./client'), the focus of this challenge is entirely on the API simulating transaction operations, so the client project is merely to play around with the api. All projects has it's own `README.md` with guidelines to run and test it.
